# ðŸ§  CNN Training: Standard vs Memory-Efficient Approaches

This repository explores two distinct methods of training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification:

- **Standard Approach**: Loading the dataset into memory.
- **Memory-Efficient Approach**: Streaming images directly from URLs to conserve RAM usage.

By comparing these workflows, this project provides insight into practical deep learning on machines with limited memory resources.
